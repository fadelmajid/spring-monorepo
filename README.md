# Spring Boot Monorepo

A monorepo containing multiple Spring Boot microservices.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Gradle 8.12+

## Getting Started

### Build all services
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Build specific service
```bash
./gradlew :services:service-a:build
```

### Run tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```
## Analysis
### Advantages of the Monorepo Approach with Gradle

1. **Unified Dependency Management**  
   - *Benefit*: Centralized version control for all services ensures consistent dependency versions
   - *Example*: Spring Boot version is managed in root `build.gradle.kts` for all services

2. **Atomic Changes**  
   - *Strength*: Cross-service changes can be made and tested in a single commit
   - *Use Case*: Updating shared security configurations across all services simultaneously

3. **Shared Build Logic**  
   - *Efficiency*: Common build configurations inherited by all services reduce duplication
   - *Implementation*: Centralized quality gates (checkstyle, PMD) in root project

4. **Simplified CI/CD**  
   - *Advantage*: Single pipeline can handle inter-service dependencies and build ordering
   - *Optimization*: Cache reuse across service builds reduces total build time

### Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Build Complexity**  
   - *Challenge*: Complex Gradle configuration required for proper project isolation  
   - *Mitigation*: Use `subprojects` configuration and clear plugin boundaries  
   ```kotlin:README.md
   // Root build.gradle.kts
   configure(subprojects) {
       apply(plugin = "spring-boot") // Isolated plugin application
   }
   ```

2. **Scalability Limits**  
   - *Issue*: Full monorepo builds become slower as services grow  
   - *Solution*: Implement incremental builds and parallel execution  
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build --parallel --configure-on-demand
   ```

3. **Dependency Conflicts**  
   - *Risk*: Shared dependency versions might cause unexpected conflicts  
   - *Prevention*: Use Gradle's platform BOM imports  
   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       implementation(platform("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies:3.1.0"))
   }
   ```

4. **IDE Performance**  
   - *Challenge*: Large monorepos can strain IDE resources  
   - *Optimization*: Use Gradle's composite builds for focused development  
   ```bash
   ./gradlew --include-build services/service-a
   ```

### Key Trade-offs

| Aspect          | Monorepo Approach                                  | Alternative (Multi-repo)             |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Code Sharing    | ✅ Immediate access to shared code               | ❌ Requires package publishing       |
| Consistency     | ✅ Uniform tooling across services               | ❌ Potential configuration drift      |
| Build Times     | ⚠️ Full builds scale linearly                   | ✅ Isolated service builds           |
| Onboarding      | ✅ Single setup process                         | ❌ Multiple repo configurations needed|

**Recommendation**: This approach is ideal for medium-sized projects (5-15 services) with tight integration requirements. For larger ecosystems (>20 services), consider hybrid approaches using Gradle composite builds.
